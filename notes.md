# Notes 9/22

## Progression of the course

### Machine learning approach

* Reflex learning
	* No real processing, simple return on values
	* Apply weights using training data

### State based models

* Three types
	* Search problems
	* Markov decision processes (Pacman, you know how the ghost moves)
	* Adversarial problems (i.e. chess)

### Variable based models

* Constraint satisfaction

* Bayesian networks

### Logic

* NLP

### Optimization

> Discrete
* Models _are_ optimization problems
	* Tool dynamic programming

> Continuous

> Ex 1 - Edit distance

> Ex 2 - Finding the least squares line
